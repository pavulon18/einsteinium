NOTE:  I am not planning on actually working on this code.  Instead, I am going to see if I can get it to work under some continuous integration service.  From there, I want to try to get it to compile for the Raspberry Pi.  I succeeded in compiling this on my RPi.  Knowing that it can be compiled on the RPi, it was the logical place to start.

Last night's attempt failed.  Travis didn't even try to build this.  So, I'm going to try a different method.

Einsteinium Core integration/staging tree
=====================================

[![Build Status](https://api.travis-ci.org/emc2foundation/einsteinium.svg?branch=0.13_master_EMC2)](https://travis-ci.org/emc2foundation/einsteinium)

https://emc2.foundation

Repo & Branches:
----------------

The default branch is always set to the latest release or RC - for the first re-merge to Litecoin it is 0.13.x (coming soon) Releases and RCs are always tagged.

Dev branches are in place for online and offline development - contributors please create your own fork or branch

The "master" branch is currently used to rebase the latest Litecoin code - otherwise it stays untouched

The current, deprecated Einsteinium 0.9.2 wallet is available as a tagged branch as well

What is Einsteinium?
----------------

Einsteinium is an experimental digital currency that enables instant payments to
anyone, anywhere in the world. Einsteinium uses peer-to-peer technology to operate
with no central authority: managing transactions and issuing money are carried
out collectively by the network. Einsteinium Core is the name of open source
software which enables the use of this currency.

Development Process
-------------------

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable. [Tags](https://github.com/emc2foundation/einsteinium/tags) //ToDo: change after first release //are created
regularly to indicate new official, stable release versions of Einsteinium Core.

The contribution workflow is described in [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).

The developer [mailing list](https://add mailing list link)
should be used to discuss complicated or controversial changes before working
on a patch set.

Developers can easily be reached on our [Slack](http://emc2slack.herokuapp.com/).

Testing
-------

Testing and code review is the bottleneck for development; we get more pull
requests than we can review and test on short notice. Please be patient and help out by testing
other people's pull requests, and remember this is a security-critical project where any mistake might cost people
lots of money.

### Automated Testing

Developers are strongly encouraged to write [unit tests](/doc/unit-tests.md) for new code, and to
submit new unit tests for old code. Unit tests can be compiled and run
(assuming they weren't disabled in configure) with: `make check`

There are also [regression and integration tests](/qa) of the RPC interface, written
in Python, that are run automatically on the build server.
These tests can be run (if the [test dependencies](/qa) are installed) with: `qa/pull-tester/rpc-tests.py`

The Travis CI system makes sure that every pull request is built for Windows, Linux, and OS X, and that unit/sanity tests are run automatically.

### Manual Quality Assurance (QA) Testing

Changes should be tested by somebody other than the developer who wrote the
code. This is especially important for large or high-risk changes. It is useful
to add a test plan to the pull request description if testing the changes is
not straightforward.

Translations
------------

We only accept translation fixes that are submitted through [Bitcoin Core's Transifex page](https://www.transifex.com/projects/p/bitcoin/).
Translations are converted to Einsteinium periodically.

Translations are periodically pulled from Transifex and merged into the git repository. See the
[translation process](doc/translation_process.md) for details on how this works.

**Important**: We do not accept translation changes as GitHub pull requests because the next
pull from Transifex would automatically overwrite them again.
